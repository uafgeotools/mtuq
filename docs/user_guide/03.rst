Acquiring Green's functions
===========================

The response of a medium to an impulsive source is called a Green's function.  This page describes the role of Green's functions in source inversions, the types of Green's functions supported by MTUQ, and how these types can be obtained.


Role of Green's functions
-------------------------

By combining Green's functions, it is possible to obtain synthetics from any moment tensor or force source.  Generating synthetics in this way is useful because it provides cost savings compared with on-the-fly wavefield simulations. Synthetics can then be compared with data to determine a best-fitting source.



`GreensTensor` objects
----------------------

`GreensTensor <https://uafgeotools.github.io/mtuq/library/generated/mtuq.GreensTensor.html>`_ objects provide access to a set of Green's functions describing the medium response between a given station and origin.  

Methods built into the `GreensTensor` class allow data processing and synthetics generation.  In particular, the `get_synthetics <https://uafgeotools.github.io/mtuq/library/generated/mtuq.GreensTensor.get_synthetics.html#mtuq.GreensTensor.get_synthetics>`_ method accepts a `MomentTensor` or `Force` and returns corresponding synthetics for the given station.




Downloading precomputed Green's functions
-----------------------------------------

An easy way to acquire Green's functions is to download them from `syngine <http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/syngine/>`_, a webservice that hosts Green's functions from the following 1D Earth models: `PREM`, `AK135`, and `iasp91`.

To download AK135 Green's functions and generate MTUQ `GreensTensor` objects:

.. code ::

   from mtuq import download_greens_functions
   greens_tensors = download_greens_functions(stations, origins, model="ak135f_2s")

A limitation of syngine is that Green's functions can be downloaded only on a station-by-station basis, not over an entire subset of Earth.  An alternative for acquiring Green's functions, which avoids this limitation, is to perform your own Green's functions simulations.




Computing Green's functions from 1D Earth models
------------------------------------------------

MTUQ supports the following 1D Green's functions formats: AxiSEM (preferred) and FK.

`AxiSEM <https://github.com/geodynamics/axisem>`_ performs spectral element wave simulations in radially-symmetric Earth models.  To generate synthetics in a format MTUQ natively supports, follow the instructions for in the `AxiSEM user manual <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geodynamics/axisem/master/MANUAL/manual_axisem1.3.pdf>`_  under "Output wavefields in NetCDF formated needed by instaseis."  AxiSEM NetCDF files can be used to retrieve vertical, radial, and transverse  displacement in units of m*(N-m)^-1.

To open an AxiSEM database client in MTUQ:

.. code ::

   from mtuq import open_db
   db = open_db(path_to_NetCDF_file, format="AxiSEM")


`FK <https://www.eas.slu.edu/People/LZhu/home.html>`_ simulates wave propagation in horizontally-layered elastic media using a frequency-wavenumber method.   FK  simulations create SAC files in a directory tree organized by model, event depth, and event distance.  Each SAC file represents a vertical, radial, or transverse velocity time series in units of 10^-20*cm*(dyne-cm)^-1 s^-1.


To open an FK database client in MTUQ:

.. code ::

   from mtuq import open_db
   db = open_db(path_to_FK_directory_tree, format="FK")



Once opened, an AxiSEM or FK database client can be used to generate `GreensTensor <https://uafgeotools.github.io/mtuq/library/generated/mtuq.GreensTensor.html>`_ objects as follows:

.. code::

   greens_tensors = db.get_greens_tensors(stations, origin)





Computing Green's functions from 3D Earth models
------------------------------------------------

MTUQ currently supports 3D Green's functions from SPECFEM3D.  

To generate a complete Green's function database for a given hypocenter and depth, six SPECFEM3D wavefield simulations are required.  Output must be saved as SAC files at individual stations using the following filename convention, which comes from `GRD_CMT3D <https://github.com/UTCompSeismo/GRD_CMT3D/tree/master/cmt3d>`_.  Place all SAC files corresponding to a single hypocenter and depth in the same directory as follows:

.. code ::

  {basedir}/{event_id}/
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.Z.Mrr.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.Z.Mtt.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.Z.Mpp.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.Z.Mrt.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.Z.Mrp.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.Z.Mtp.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.R.Mrr.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.R.Mtt.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.R.Mpp.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.R.Mrt.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.R.Mrp.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.R.Mtp.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.T.Mrr.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.T.Mtt.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.T.Mpp.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.T.Mrt.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.T.Mrp.sac
      {net}.{sta}.{loc}.T.Mtp.sac


To open an SPECFEM3D database client in MTUQ:

.. code ::

   from mtuq import open_db
   db = open_db(path_SPECFEM3D_output_directory, format="SPECFEM3D")


Once opened, a SPECFEM3D database client can be used to generate `GreensTensor <https://uafgeotools.github.io/mtuq/library/generated/mtuq.GreensTensor.html>`_ objects as follows:

.. code::

   greens_tensors = db.get_greens_tensors(stations, origin)



Green's function conventions
----------------------------

A variety of Green's function conventions exist.  Figuring out which are used in a particular application can be challenging because it depends on

- the type of medium under consideration (for example, acoustic media require fewer independent Green's functions than elastic media)

- the symmetry of the medium (for example, 1D media require fewer independent Green's functions than 3D media)

- the choice of local Cartesian basis conventions (for example, some authors employ `up-south-east`, others `north-east-down`; see `ObsPy documentation <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.imaging.mopad_wrapper.beach.html#supported-basis-systems>`_ for more information)

A major goal is to avoid exposing users to unnecessary basis complexity. MTUQ accomplishes this by understanding external formats and converting to a common internal format that works for both 1D and 3D media. 

For internally storing moment tensors, forces, and Green's functions, MTUQ consistently uses an `up-south-east` Cartesian convention.
